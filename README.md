<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I started developing this project as my final course presentation, in the hopes of creating something different than usual and to challenge myself to bring an original idea to life. I have encountered some problems while developing it, due to some lack of documentation on the libraries that I used on this project, but I hope this project can help you out adapting this virtual assistant to your needs and that you may learn about virtual assistants and create your own or create new functions for Brian adapting it to your needs. :D
